# Development Experience

## Tool Selection
I chose Replit Agent because it was easy to use and did not require installing any programs on my computer. As a beginner, this was important for me.

## Development Process
First, I explained what kind of application I wanted to build in simple sentences. The AI then generated the code for the project. At the beginning, the application did not work correctly, but I used the debugging option and the problem was fixed.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges was understanding the code that the AI generated. Since I am still learning programming, some parts were confusing. However, reading the comments and testing the application helped me understand it better.

## Personal Evaluation
Overall, this experience was useful for me. It showed that AI-assisted development can help beginners create working applications and feel more motivated to learn programming.
